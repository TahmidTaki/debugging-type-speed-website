    <h1>Difference between local storage and session storage</h1>
    <p>The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the data is
        saved for and who the data is accessible to.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>local storage</th>
            <th>session storage</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Session storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser</td>
            <td>whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB</td>
            <td>The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually</td>
            <td>Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of
                a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed</td>
        </tr>
    </table>


    <h1>difference between local scope and block scope</h1>
    <p>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new
        JavaScript keywords: let and const.

        These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <h3>Block Scope</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block</li>
        <li>Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.</li>

        <li> Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Global Scope</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

        </li>
        <li>Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

        </li>
        <li> Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.</li>
    </ol>


    <h1>How many ways JS shows undefined</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Variable with no value</li>
        <li>variable has not been assigned a value</li>
        <li>when calling a non-existent property of an object</li>
        <li>when calling a non-existent method of an object</li>
        <li>When passing less arguments in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value.</li>
        <li>Funtion with no return value will give undefined</li>
        <li>return statement with no return value, just writing --> return; </li>
        <li>Array element outside index range</li>
        <li>deleting an element inside an array, that index value would be undefined</li>
        <li>setting a value to undefined</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How event loop works (Simplified)</h1>
    <p>JS stacks its sync functions in a stack. For call-back functions, each call-back is pushed on top of the stack.
        When the execution of the top of stack function is finished, it is popped out and the next top function is
        executed and it goes on like that until the stack it empty. if any async function/task is to be executed, that
        task is inially kept in an queue, and it waits for the micro tasks in the stack to be finished. when the stack
        is empty, the first task from the queue is pushed into the stack and that task is executed. after that, any
        remaining queue elements are pushed into the stack one by one and gets executed.</p>
