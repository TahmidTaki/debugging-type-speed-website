    <h1>Difference between local storage and session storage</h1>
    <p>The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the data is
        saved for and who the data is accessible to.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>local storage</th>
            <th>session storage</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Session storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser</td>
            <td>whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration date.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB</td>
            <td>The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually</td>
            <td>Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of
                a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed</td>
        </tr>
    </table>


    <h1>difference between local scope and block scope</h1>
    <p>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new
        JavaScript keywords: let and const.

        These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <h3>Block Scope</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block</li>
        <li>Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.</li>

        <li> Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Global Scope</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

        </li>
        <li>Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

        </li>
        <li> Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.</li>
    </ol>


    <h1>How many ways JS shows undefined</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Variable with no value</li>
        <li>variable has not been assigned a value</li>
        <li>when calling a non-existent property of an object</li>
        <li>when calling a non-existent method of an object</li>
        <li>When passing less arguments in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value.</li>
        <li>Funtion with no return value will give undefined</li>
        <li>return statement with no return value, just writing --> return; </li>
        <li>Array element outside index range</li>
        <li>deleting an element inside an array, that index value would be undefined</li>
        <li>setting a value to undefined</li>
    </ul>
